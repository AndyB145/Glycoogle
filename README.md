# Glycoogle
Code that interfaces with SIB to perform structure searches on glycan databases.

This is a proof of concept to evaluate the utility of ranking glycan structures based on similarity. This implementation uses a levenshtein string edit distance to calculate a similarity score. The results are then reordered according to this score.
